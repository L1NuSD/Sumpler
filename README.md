# Sumpler

Sumpler is a sampler designed using Csound Cabbage. The purpose of the project is to process sounds in nature to create interesting sound effects.
### Design 
The sampler provides users with control over sample pitch, speed, and level. It features a bit crusher module using the opcode in Csound written by Iain Mccurdy. 

The reverb in Sumpler is a 8 delay line stereo FDN Sean Costello reverb with feedback control, filter cut-off control, and a dry-wet mix control.

 The sampler also enables user to change the FFT size of the sample to create unique spectral audio results.

A series of nature sounds could be choose in the drop-down menu, and users are free to save their own presets inside the plug-in.
